JavaScript basics
=================

[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is a scripting language that was originally designed to allow adding dynamic and interactive content to static websites. It is relatively easy to learn and free online tutorials are available by [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) and other sources.

## The browser environment

JavaScript applications require an [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) and cannot be run as standalone programmes. Most JavaScript applications are designed to run either in a web browser on a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) environment. The EpiCurrents library is designed to utilize the [V8 engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)) found in Chromium-based web browsers, namely Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, although limited functionality may be available in other web browsers as well.
